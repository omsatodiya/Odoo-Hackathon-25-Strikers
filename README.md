## About SkillSwap

SkillSwap is a modern Skill Exchange Platform designed to connect people who want to teach and learn new skills. The platform enables users to list their skills, discover others with complementary skills, and request skill swaps in a secure, community-driven environment.

### Motive & What We Built

**SkillSwap** was created to foster a collaborative learning community where everyone can be both a teacher and a learner. Our goal is to break down barriers to skill acquisition by making it easy for users to:

- **List their skills**: Users can create a profile, add the skills they can teach, and specify the skills they want to learn.
- **Discover talented people**: The homepage features a searchable, filterable list of users, making it easy to find potential skill swap partners based on skills, location, and more.
- **Request and manage swaps**: Users can send requests to others for skill swaps, manage incoming and outgoing requests, and communicate securely through the platform.
- **Admin dashboard**: Includes robust admin features for user management, verification, banning/unbanning, and analytics (user growth, activity, etc.).
- **Authentication & Security**: Secure authentication, role-based access control, and real-time updates using Firebase and Firestore.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Radix UI for a beautiful, mobile-first experience.
- **Animations & UX**: Smooth, minimal animations using Framer Motion and GSAP for a delightful user experience.

SkillSwap is more than just a directory—it's a community platform for meaningful connections, knowledge sharing, and personal growth.
